## OWASP 10 categories
The OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications. When integrating security into your CI/CD pipeline, it's essential to consider these risks and implement checks to mitigate them.

Here are the OWASP Top 10 risks and corresponding CI/CD checks you can implement:

1. Injection
Check: Use static analysis tools to detect potential injection vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, command injection).
Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx, Snyk
2. Broken Authentication
Check: Ensure that authentication mechanisms are robust and not vulnerable to attacks like brute force.
Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, custom scripts for brute force testing
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
Check: Scan for hardcoded secrets, ensure data encryption in transit and at rest.
Tools: TruffleHog, GitLeaks, Talisman
4. XML External Entities (XXE)
Check: Use static analysis tools to detect XXE vulnerabilities.
Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx
5. Broken Access Control
Check: Perform access control testing to ensure proper authorization checks are in place.
Tools: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
6. Security Misconfiguration
Check: Scan for misconfigurations in your infrastructure and applications.
Tools: OpenVAS, Nessus, CIS-CAT
7. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Check: Use static and dynamic analysis tools to detect XSS vulnerabilities.
Tools: SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
8. Insecure Deserialization
Check: Use static analysis tools to detect insecure deserialization vulnerabilities.
Tools: SonarQube, Checkmarx
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
Check: Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
Tools: Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check
10. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
Check: Ensure that logging and monitoring are in place and configured correctly.
Tools: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Prometheus
